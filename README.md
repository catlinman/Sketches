# Processing Sketches #

Collection of sketches written in Processing. I create these when I am bored and
have nothing better to do so don't expect too much here. I try to work on new
ideas whenever I get a chance but I can not guarantee regular activity.

Some designs and sketches that end up here were part of another creative process
and might still even be used. In that sense, a few sketches here allow for
an iterative approach to designing and representing new ideas.

If you want a fun hands on example, I'd recommend checking out the *GridRules*
sketch and its source code! Have fun playing around!

## Setup ##

To get started, make sure you have [Processing](https://processing.org/) installed.

From there on, load up a sketch and run it within the application. Alternatively
you can install *processing-java* from within the application to access the
command line tools.

## Note ##

In retrospect some sketches and their corresponding source code have not aged
well. A few were very hastily thrown together while others have been worked on
a lot more. You'll probably be able to tell by how strict typing and more
Java-esque the source is from sketch to sketch.

At the end of the day though, it works - or at least should!
